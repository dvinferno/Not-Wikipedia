            <h4>Geography</h4>
            <p>
                <!-- Geography -->
                The world of <i>One Piece</i> is populated by humans and
                many other
                races, such as the Longarm Tribe
                (a tribe composed of humanoids with long arms), the Longleg
                Tribe
                (race of very long-legged individuals), fish-men and merfolk
                (two
                races of
                fish/human hybrids), dwarves, minks (a race of humanoids
                with animal
                features), Lunarians and Sky Islands residents (winged
                humanoids similar to angels)
                and giants. It is covered by
                two vast oceans, which are divided by a massive mountain
                range
                called the Red Line, which is
                also the only continent in the world.
                The Grand Line, a sea
                that runs perpendicular to the Red Line, further divides
                them into
                four seas: North Blue,
                East Blue, West
                Blue, and
                South Blue.
                Surrounding the Grand Line are two regions called Calm
                Belts, which
                experience almost no wind or ocean currents
                and are the breeding ground for huge sea creatures called
                sea kings.
                Because
                of this, the calm belts are very effective barriers for
                those trying
                to enter the Grand Line. However, navy
                ships, members of an intergovernmental organization known as
                the
                World Government, are able to use a sea-prism stone to
                mask their presence from the sea kings and can simply pass
                through
                the calm belts. All other ships are forced to take a more
                dangerous
                route, going through a mountain at the first intersection of
                the
                Grand Line and the Red Line, a canal system known as Reverse
                Mountain.
                Sea water from each of the four seas runs up that mountain
                and
                merges at the top to flow down a fifth canal and into the
                first half
                of the Grand Line, called Paradise because how it compared
                to the
                second half. The second half
                of the Grand Line, beyond the second intersection with the
                Red Line,
                is known as the New World.

                    The currents and weather of the Grand Line's open sea
                    are
                    extremely
                    unpredictable, whereas in the vicinity of islands the
                    climate is
                    stable.
                    The magnetic fields within the Grand Line cause normal
                    compasses
                    to
                    malfunction, making it even more difficult to navigate,
                    and
                    instead
                    a
                    special compass called a Log Pose must be used. The Log
                    Pose
                    functions by
                    locking on to one island's magnetic field and then
                    locking on to
                    another
                    island's magnetic field. The time for it to set depends
                    on the
                    island.
                    This process can be bypassed by obtaining an Eternal
                    Pose, a Log
                    Pose
                    variation that is permanently set to a specific island
                    and never
                    changes.

                <h4>Devil Fruits</h4>
                <p>
                    A Devil Fruit is a type of fruit that, when eaten,
                    grants a
                    power
                    to the eater. A person may only eat one Devil Fruit
                    during their
                    lifetime, as eating a second Devil Fruit will swiftly
                    end their
                    life.
                    There are three categories of Devil Fruits;
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Paramecia is a category of fruits that gives the
                            user
                            various superhuman abilities, such
                            as Buggy's capacity to separate his body parts,
                            Nico
                            Robin's
                            appendage
                            generation or Brook's self-revival.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Logia fruits give control
                            over and allow the user "to change their living
                            body
                            structure into the
                            powers of nature", like Smoker's control over
                            smoke,
                            Portgas
                            D. Ace's
                            control over fire, and Sir Crocodile's control
                            over
                            sand.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Zoan
                            fruits allow the user to fully or partially
                            transform
                            into a
                            specific
                            animal, like how Tony Tony Chopper can transform
                            into a
                            human-reindeer
                            hybrid. Certain Zoan fruits allow the user to
                            transform
                            into
                            prehistoric
                            creatures, like X Drake being able to turn into
                            an
                            Allosaurus, and even
                            mythical creatures, like how Marco can transform
                            into a
                            phoenix. Through
                            an unknown technique developed by scientist Dr.
                            Vegapunk,
                            inanimate
                            objects can also "eat" a Devil Fruit and gain
                            sentience,
                            like how
                            Spandam's sword become an elephant.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Devil Fruits are said to be
                    incarnations of the sea devil himself and as a result,
                    Devil
                    Fruit
                    users
                    cannot swim in sea water as "they are hated by the sea".
                    When
                    even
                    partially submerged in sea water, they lose all their
                    strength
                    and
                    coordination, although some abilities remain. For
                    example, Luffy
                    is
                    still
                    able to stretch after being totally submerged. Sea-prism
                    stone
                    also
                    has
                    this effect. Moving water, such as rain or waves, does
                    not have
                    this
                    effect. When a Devil Fruit user dies, the powers
                    reincarnate
                    into a
                    new
                    Devil Fruit. For unknown reasons, Devil Fruit users
                    cannot eat a
                    second
                    Devil Fruit because it would cause their bodies to
                    burst,
                    although
                    series
                    antagonist Blackbeard manages to obtain a second Devil
                    Fruit
                    power
                    through
                    an unknown method. Devil Fruit powers can also be
                    "awakened",
                    greatly
                    increasing the power and utility of the user's
                    abilities. There
                    is
                    also an artificial Devil Fruit created by Caesar Clown
                    called
                    the
                    SMILE
                    which enables the user to obtain the abilities of a
                    specific
                    animal,
                    but
                    having only partially a part of the animal such as the
                    legs,
                    ears,
                    or the
                    head protruding from any limb of the body, like the head
                    of an
                    animal in
                    the stomach or in place of the hand, wings in the head
                    or the
                    waist,
                    or an
                    animal appearing in place of their legs.

                <h4>Haki</h4>
                <p>
                    Haki is a latent ability that every living
                    being in the world of One Piece possesses; very few
                    manage to
                    awaken
                    it, and even fewer master it. There are three varieties
                    of Haki:
                    Color of Observation (Kenbunshoku no Haki) allows one to
                    sense the presence of other beings and to have a form of
                    limited
                    precognition. Color of Arms (Busōshoku no Haki) allows
                    one
                    to envelop body parts and even inanimate objects with a
                    force
                    akin
                    to an invisible armor that possesses defensive and
                    offensive
                    properties. It also allows one to inflict harm upon
                    Logia-type
                    Devil
                    Fruit users. The rare Color of the Supreme King
                    (Haōshoku no
                    Haki) is an ability that, unlike the other two Haki,
                    only a few
                    gifted people have. The Color of the Supreme King
                    enables one to
                    overpower the will of the weak-willed. It can be used to
                    force
                    others into submission or even render victims
                    unconscious.
                    Strong-willed people can withstand, or even completely
                    ignore,
                    the
                    effects of this Haki, even if they do not possess the
                    ability
                    themselves. This Haki can also have physical impact,
                    such as
                    causing
                    shock waves and destruction to the user's surroundings.

                    chapter and volume. They both featured the character of
                    Luffy,
                    and included elements that would appear later in the
                    main
                    series. The first of these short stories was published
                    in August

                    later in

                <h3 id="Development">Development</h3>
                <p>When creating a Devil Fruit, Oda thinks of something that
                    would
                    fulfill a human desire; he added that he does not see
                    why he
                    would draw a Devil Fruit unless the fruit's appearance
                    would
                    entice one to eat it.
                    The names of many special attacks, as well as other
                    concepts in
                    the manga, consist of a form of punning in which phrases
                    written
                    in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji"
                            title="Kanji">kanji</a></i> are
                    paired with an idiosyncratic reading. The names of some
                    characters' techniques are often mixed with other
                    languages, and
                    the names of several of Zoro's sword techniques are
                    designed as
                    jokes; they look fearsome when read by sight but sound
                    like
                    kinds of food when read aloud. For example, Zoro's
                    signature
                    move is <i>Onigiri</i>, which is written as <i>demon cut</i>
                    but
                    is pronounced the same as <a

                    Eisaku
                    Inoue, the animation director, has said that the
                    creators did
                    not use these <i>kanji</i> readings in the anime since
                    they
                    "might have cut down the laughs by about half".
                    Nevertheless, <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konosuke_Uda"
                        class="mw-redirect"
                        title="Konosuke Uda">Konosuke Uda</a>, the director,
                    said
                    that he believes that the creators "made the anime
                    pretty close
                    to the manga".
                </p>

                <p>Oda was "sensitive" about how his work would be
                    translated.
                    In many instances, the English version of the <i>One
                        Piece</i>
                    manga uses one <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onomatopoeia"
                        title="Onomatopoeia">onomatopoeia</a> for multiple
                    onomatopoeia used in the Japanese version. For instance,
                    "<i>saaa</i>"
                    (the sound of light rain, close to a mist) and "<i>zaaa</i>"
                    (the sound of pouring rain) are both translated as
                    "fshhhhhhh".
                    Unlike other manga artists, Oda draws everything that
                    moves
                    himself to create a consistent look while leaving his
                    staff to
                    draw the backgrounds based on sketches he has drawn. In
                    this
                    way, he wishes to maintain a uniform representation,
                    leaving
                    only the realization of the backgrounds to his staff,
                    based on
                    his sketches. This workload forces
                    him to keep tight production rates, starting from five
                    in the
                    morning until two in the morning the next day, with
                    short breaks
                    only for meals. Oda's work program includes the first
                    three days
                    of the week dedicated to the writing of the storyboard
                    and the
                    remaining time for the definitive inking of the boards
                    and for
                    the possible coloring. When a reader asked
                    who Nami was in love with, Oda replied that there would
                    hardly
                    be any love affairs within Luffy's crew. The author also
                    explained he deliberately avoids including them in <i>One
                        Piece</i>
                    since the series is a <a

                    who read

                <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

                <p>Oda revealed that he originally planned <i>One Piece</i>
                    to last
                    five years, and that he had already planned the ending.
                    However,
                    he found it would take longer than he had expected as
                    Oda
                    realized that he liked the story too much to end it in
                    that
                    period of time. In 2016,
                    nineteen years after the start of serialization, the
                    author said
                    that the manga has reached 65% of the story he intends
                    to tell.
                    In July 2018, on the occasion of the twenty-first
                    anniversary of
                    <i>One Piece</i>, Oda said that the manga has reached
                    80% of the
                    plot, while in January
                    2019, he said that <i>One Piece</i> is on its way to the
                    conclusion, but that it could exceed the 100th volume.
                    In August 2019, Oda said that, according to his
                    predictions, the
                    manga will end between 2024 and 2025.
                    However, Oda stated that the ending would be what he had
                    decided
                    in the beginning; he is committed to seeing it through.
                    In a
                    television special aired in Japan, Oda said he would be
                    willing
                    to change the ending if the fans were to be able to
                    predict it.
                    In August
                    2020, Shueisha announced in the year's 35th issue of <i>Weekly
                        Shōnen Jump</i> that <i>One Piece</i> was "headed
                    toward the
                    upcoming final saga." On January 4, 2021,
                    <i>One Piece</i> reached its thousandth chapter.
                    In June 2022, Oda announced that the manga would enter a
                    one-month break to prepare for its 25th anniversary and
                    its
                    final saga, set to begin with the release of chapter
                    1054.
